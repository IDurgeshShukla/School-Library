# School-Library
The School Library Management System is a comprehensive backend project designed to efficiently manage library operations within a school. It provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to manage authors, books, library cards, and student transactions. The system is built using the Spring framework and utilizes a MySQL database for data storage.

Key Features:

Author Management:
Librarians can add new authors to the library database, including their personal information and bibliographical details.

Book Management:
Librarians can associate books with the library when new books are acquired. Book details, such as title, author, genre, and publication date, are stored in the database.

Library Card Generation:
Librarians have the capability to generate library cards for students. Each card is associated with a unique student and provides essential details like the student's name, ID, and card issue date.

Book Issuance and Return:
Students can use their library cards to borrow books from the library. Librarians record the issuance and return of books, associating them with the respective student and due dates.

Transaction Tracking:
Librarians can monitor and track all transactions made by students, including book issuance and return. This feature ensures accurate record-keeping and helps maintain library resources.

Fine Management:
In case a student fails to return a book within the specified time frame, a fine is generated. The system calculates a fine of 5 Rs per day for late returns.

Database Integration:
All library data, including author details, book records, student information, library card data, and transaction history, is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database.

The School Library Management System streamlines library operations, enhances data accuracy, and promotes efficient book circulation. It provides librarians with the necessary tools to manage resources effectively and ensures students have access to a well-organized library with a clear lending policy. The system's fine management feature encourages timely book returns, promoting responsible borrowing habits among students.
